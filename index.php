          <h2>Purpose</h2>
          <p>Invictus Woods is the premier sober living facility in the Midwest. Our purpose is to build a strong foundation for men who are in the early stages of the recovery process. Our focus is on structure and individual goals for each participant. At Invictus Woods we view the disease in a realistic way. We know that recovery is not about being powerless. It is about empowerment. Our goal is to locate what motivates a man and integrate it into his consciousness so he can rebuild his life, move forward and become a productive member of society.</p>

          <h2>Mission</h2>
          <p>Invictus Woods Extended Care is committed to providing a safe and caring sober living environment for men (18 and older) recovering from the effects of chemical dependency and other associated behaviors caused by drug and alcohol addiction. Our program builds on the initial therapeutic 12-step process to create a stronger foundation of recovery. We believe recovery does not have to be seen as punishment, and our primary focus is to teach our clients how to stay sober and enjoy the healing process. Set on 35 acres of wooded wilderness outside of Peoria, Illinois, Invictus Woods offers a clean, enjoyable and private sober living community to address the needs of each person. Our program is led by compassionate staff members who recognize there is a kind and loving person inside each one of us.</p>

          <h2>Why Invictus Woods</h2>
          <p>What sets our program apart from other extended care and sober living programs is the individual attention and personal care given to each resident. Through education, group sessions, wilderness expeditions and 12-step meetings, our participants engage in a mental, physical, and spiritual experience which is essential to long-term recovery. We believe a sober lifestyle takes hard work, but can also be fun and meaningful.</p>
		  <p>We truly concentrate on the needs and concerns of each person in our program. We are dedicated to bringing out the best in each participant and creating new behaviors that promote lasting change. We believe in engaging the mind, body and spirit in a comprehensive manner for balanced living in the real world. Building a new life takes a firm commitment, and we will guide our participants in that process.</p>
